## What is a Parliamentary Question?
Parliamentary Questions are a fundamental mechanism for accountability in parliamentary systems. They allow elected representatives to formally question government ministers about policies, decisions, and actions.

## The Challenge
Government departments face significant challenges when handling PQs:

* **Volume**: In the UK alone, approximately 40,000 parliamentary questions are asked annually.
* **Resource intensive**: Each PQ requires research, drafting, fact-checking, and multiple approval stages
* **Expertise required**: Responses must align with official policy positions, be factually accurate, and maintain appropriate tone
* **Time-sensitive**: Departments typically have strict deadlines (often 24-48 hours) to provide comprehensive responses

Current processes are labor-intensive, with each question requiring hours of civil servant time and sometimes coordination across multiple departments. Automating part of this process could significantly contribute to productivity and efficiency savings. 

## Our Solution
The Parliamentary Question Responder streamlines this process through the following features.
